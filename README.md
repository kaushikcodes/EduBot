# EduBot
EduBot is an optimized retrieval augmented generation chatbot which can ingest large user-uploaded documents and answer specific questions about them. EduBot is trained using Google's T5 LLM, which is a self-supervised encoder-decoder model. As opposed to a basic keyword search or ChatGPT, EduBot provides the user with accurate and verbose answers - demonstrating a hallucination rate of < 3.5%. I have used Langchain's framework to create the LLM and integrated it with Huggingface's API to access the pre-trained model.
